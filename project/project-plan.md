## Title

World Cup Performance vs. GDP per capita

## Main Question

1. Do countries with higher GDPs tend to achieve better performances in the FIFA World Cup, and to what extent does economic prosperity influence a nation's success in the tournament?

## Description

The FIFA World Cup is not only a global sporting event but also a source of national pride for participating countries. Many believe that a nation's economic strength might influence its performance in the World Cup. This project seeks to investigate this hypothesis and gain insights into whether a country's economic prosperity correlates with its success in the world's most prestigious football tournament.
